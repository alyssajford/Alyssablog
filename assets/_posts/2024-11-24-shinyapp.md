<h1>What Makes a Good <em><strong>DESSERT</strong></em></h1>

---

## Introduction:

Raise your hand if you love *dessert*! I do...**sugar makes everyone happy!** That is why I decided to use this [website](https://www.food.com/) to look at the top ranked desserts and cookies out there!

Last blog post, I webscrapped a dataset that gave us the *top 100 dessert* and *top 100 cookie* recipes. After looking at the data, I wondered...
### *What is the best dessert out there?*
It was really interesting to dive deeper into what makes a top ranked dessert! üç∞üç™

An insight I found was that a majority of the desserts and cookies were described as **"delicious"**, **"perfect"**, and **"sweet"**. This isn't much of a surprise as I would probably use these words to describe my favorite desserts! Here is a graph from my last post to view the distribution of adjectives used to describe each dessert.

Another insight I found from my last post was that both of the number one ranks used chocolate. The top ranked cookie was <u>Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</u> *yum* and the top ranked dessert was <u>The Ultimate Chocolate Cake</u>.

The next step to dive deeper into these insights was to create and R Shiny app! Here is the [link](https://shiny.posit.co/) to the R Shiny app for you to create your own app! 

To start on my app, I imported all of my necessary packages.
