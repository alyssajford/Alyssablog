<h1>What Makes a Good <em><strong>DESSERT</strong></em></h1>

---

## Introduction:

Raise your hand if you love *dessert*! I do...**sugar makes everyone happy!** That is why I decided to use this [website](https://www.food.com/) to look at the top ranked desserts and cookies out there!

Last blog post, I webscrapped a dataset that gave us the *top 100 dessert* and *top 100 cookie* recipes. After looking at the data, I wondered...
### *What is the best dessert out there?*
It was really interesting to dive deeper into what makes a top ranked dessert! üç∞üç™

An insight I found was that a majority of the desserts and cookies were described as **"delicious"**, **"perfect"**, and **"sweet"**. This isn't much of a surprise as I would probably use these words to describe my favorite desserts! Here is a graph from my last post to view the distribution of adjectives used to describe each dessert.

Another insight I found from my last post was that both of the number one ranks used chocolate. The top ranked cookie was <u>Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</u> *yum* and the top ranked dessert was <u>The Ultimate Chocolate Cake</u>.

The next step to dive deeper into these insights was to create and R Shiny app! Here is the [link](https://shiny.posit.co/) to the R Shiny app for you to create your own app! 

## Purpose:

R Shiny apps are **great** for visualizing data in an interactive way! We can create features on an app for users to understand the data better. 

I wanted to create an app where individuals could explore different desserts and see which recipes they would **enjoy** through rank and different adjectives!

---

## Features:

To start on my app, I imported all of my necessary packages, and made a requirements.txt file for streamlit. 

<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post3 - requirements.png" alt="requirements" width = "500" height = "400">

Then, I was ready to be creative. 
My app contains:
- two tabs where you can choose **Dessert Adjectives** or **Ranked Desserts**
- A side bar to...**filter** between *Cookies*,  *Dessert*, or *Both*...**input** a certain adjective from the list...and **choose** a certain rank to investigate
- More features inside each tab that we will *investgate now*

In this example, I input the adjective **Delicious** and I am inside the dessert adjectives tab. I also chose both desserts and cookies to show.
At the top of this tab, it shows a list of all the desserts that contain the word **Delicious**

<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post3 - adjevtives1.png" alt="Adjectives" width = "600" height = "400">

Another feature on this tab is a graph that shows the amount of recipes with that adjective vs. the total number of recipes!
Here is a *picture*

<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post3 - adjectives2.png" alt="Graph Adjectives" width = "600" height = "400">

The other tab, titled **Ranked Desserts** shows a big list of every *recipe name* and its *rank*
In this picture, I have filtered to only show **cookie** recipes

<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post3 - rank1.png" alt="Rank" width = "600" height = "400">

Scrolling down, it shows the recipe with the **input rank**! In this example, I chose rank 5 which gave me *Cinnamon Cookies*

## Streamlit Features:

When creating your own app on streamlit, there are some **really cool** features to add! Here are some examples from my code to get some **ideas** if you would like to create your own app.

**TABS:** You can create tabs by writing this example code where users can click betwee different screens. 
```python
import streamlit as st

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Dessert Adjectives", "Ranked Desserts"])

with tab1:
    st.write("Content for Dessert Adjectives tab goes here.")

with tab2:
    st.write("Content for Ranked Desserts tab goes here.")
On my app, my two tabs are "Dessert Adjectives" and "Ranked Desserts".
```

**SIDEBAR:** Another cool feature is a sidebar using this code 
```python
with st.sidebar:
    adjective = st.text_input("Enter an adjective:")
    rank = st.slider("Select a rank:", 1, 100)
```
My app contains a sidebar where users can filter data, input an adjective, and specify a rank

**GRAPH:** Graphs can be used to view personalized data on the app which is a great method for exploratory analysis. Here is example code
```python
fig = px.bar(data, x="Adjective", y="Count", title="Distribution of Desserts by Adjective")
st.plotly_chart(fig)
```

In my graph, users can view a chart that shows the distribution of recipes with the adjective they chose. 

**INPUT:** Users can input certain values or names to view data in a new way! Here is example code for that
```python
user_input = st.text_input("Type an adjective:")
st.write(f"You entered: {user_input}")
```
In my app, users are able to type an adjective from the list.

## Conclusion:

In my opinion, **dessert** is the **best** meal of the day. It was interesting to dive deeper into what the top ranked desserts are on this certain website. I especially liked the comments from other individuals who made the recipe. The words they used to describe each dish was helpful for me to find which desserts I would enjoy. Personally, I liked reading about all of the recipes that had **chocolate**. With the help of the R Shiny app, it was easier to navigate through the different recipes. I encourage all of you to take a look at the app to **find your favorite desserts!**
