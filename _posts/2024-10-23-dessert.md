<h1><em><strong>DESSERT</strong></em> - The Best Meal Of the Day</h1>

---

## Introduction:

Growing up, my family *loved* treats. Every weekend, we would have some sort of cookie or baked good in our pantry. I've had a sweet tooth my whole life, and I truly believe that **sugar makes everyone happy.** In other words, life is better with sugar. Now, the real question is:

### *What is the best dessert out there?*

To dive deeper into this solution, I consulted a well-known site that ranks various recipes. That website is **Food.com**. They recently compiled a top 100 list for dessert recipes and cookies. Perfect!

After browsing through these recipes (200 combined with desserts and cookies), I wanted to examine what made a recipe special enough to be in the *top 100 list*. This would require making a **dataset** of my own.

If you'd like to view these websites before the post, here they are:  
- [Dessert](https://www.food.com/ideas/top-dessert-recipes-6930?ref=nav#c-791391)  
- [Cookies](https://www.food.com/ideas/cookie-recipes-7152?ref=nav#c-932718)

Luckily, **BeautifulSoup** allows us to create our own datasets from websites. 

<img src = "{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post_2 - dessert1.png" alt = "dessert" width = "500" height = "400">

With these two tools, we are good to go! The first step in creating a dataset from a website is to **import necessary libraries** from Python. Here are the libraries I used to get my dataset, and I would recommend starting with these as you create your own!

[Here is a tutorial on how to install libraries in Python, this tutorial walks you through installing BeautifulSoup!](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beautifulsoup-installation-python/)

Next, we import the URL and check it using these functions...[This is the link for top 100 recipes](https://www.food.com/ideas/top-dessert-recipes-6930?ref=nav#c-791391)
[And here is the link for the top 100 cookie recipes](https://www.food.com/ideas/cookie-recipes-7152?ref=nav)

### **Make Sure the Website Allows Web Scraping**

As we continue in the web scraping process, it is crucial to make sure the website you use allows for web scraping. **Check the robot.txt file** to verify the rules the website has. In this example, the website allows for web scraping as per the robot.txt file.

Gathering data from a website can be tricky, but we will walk through the specific steps. Here is my code for reference. As you can see, we use functions from **BeautifulSoup** to collect the information necessary for our dataset.

### **Inspect the Website**

I was interested in five columns for my dataset: Recipe name, comment, comment name, rank, and type of article. To see where this information lies, we will inspect our website. Simply right-click the website and click the bottom option "inspect" to pull up a screen like this:

<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post2 - inspect.png" alt="Inspect the Website"width = "500" height = "400">

As we look at the dropdown, we can see that our items all fall under the **div tag** in class "smart-card container-sm recipe", as seen in my code. The tags for each column are also presented in my code.

To learn more about this, here is a website explaining more about web scraping in **BeautifulSoup**! [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-web-scraping-python-beautiful-soup/)

## My Dataset!

My dataset was created after these steps! Now going back to the beginning, I wanted to know what made a recipe special enough to be in the **top 100 recipes** for dessert and top 100 for cookies. I thought of a few ways to examine this question:

---

### **1. How many of the dessert names contain "chocolate"?**

To do this, I filtered that data to create a bar graph showing recipes with and without the word "chocolate". To me, chocolate seemed like a pretty good predictor of a high-ranked recipe. Here is the bar chart showing a count of how many recipes contain the word **"chocolate"**.

<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post2 - chocolate.png" alt="Chocolate vs. Non-Chocolate">

As we can see, **41/200 recipes** contain the word "chocolate". In other words, **20.5%** of recipes ranked in the top 100 desserts and top 100 cookie recipes had chocolate in their name. This is a relatively high percentage and was interesting to me. It seems like people enjoy dessert with chocolate. Furthermore, the **top-ranked dessert** is called, **"The Ultimate Chocolate Cake"** and the **top-ranked cookie recipe** is called, **"Thick, Soft and Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies"**, both of which contain chocolate.

---

### **2. How many times does the word "delicious" appear in a comment?**

First, I made a list of positive adjectives that describe a good recipe. Then, I made a bar graph showing a histogram of the frequency of these adjectives in the comments.

<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post2 - frequency.png" alt="Word Appearance">

The word that appears the most amongst these top-rated desserts is **"delicious"**. "Perfect", "sweet", and "moist" are also common words that appear in comments. This was interesting to me because it reflects how people feel about their food. The words that are important for a top recipe appear more in the comments made by the public.

---

### **3. Finding similarities across the top 5 dessert and cookie recipes**

Here, I created a chart showing the top 5 dessert recipe names and the top 5 cookie recipe names. It surprises me because there isn't a unified flavor or factor amongst these recipes. Some of them have chocolate, some of them have fruit, and some of them have cinnamon. This shows me that everybody has different preferences when it comes to dessert flavors. Personally, I am a chocolate girl, so that **chocolate cake** sounds really good.

## Conclusion:

**Dessert** has a wide variety of flavors and categories that are loved. I guess there isn't one specific ingredient that makes a recipe special. This is great because that means there is a recipe on this website for every person!

Here is a link directly to their website so that you can explore more recipes for yourself! Further, I encourage you to get started on your own **web scraping project!** Choose something you're interested in, confirm that the website allows for web scraping, and get started with **BeautifulSoup**!
