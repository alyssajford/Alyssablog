<h1> <em><strong> DESSERT </strong></em></h1> The Best Meal Of the Day

Introduction:

Growing up, my family loved treats. Every weekend we would have some sort of cookie or baked good in our pantry. I've had a sweet tooth my whole life and I truly believe sugar makes everyone happy.
Simply put, life is better with sugar. Now, the real question is: <em><strong> what is the best dessert out there? </strong></em></h1>

That is why I consulted a well-known site that ranks various things. That website is Food.com. They recently compiled a top 100 list for dessert recipes cookies. Perfect!
After browsing through these recipes (200 combined with dessert and cookies), I wanted to examine what made a recipe special enough to be in the top 100 list. This would require
making a dataset of my own.

If you'd like to view these websites before the post here they are!

[Cookies](https://www.food.com/ideas/cookie-recipes-7152?ref=nav#c-932718)

Luckily, BeautifulSoup allows us to create our own datasets from websites. 

<img src = "{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post_2 - dessert1.png" alt = "food.com"/>

and with these two tools, we are good to go. The first step in creating a dataset from a website is to import necessary libraries from Python. Here are the libraries I used to get my dataset, and I would recommend starting with these as you create your own dataset!
[Here is a tutorial on how to install libraries in Python, this tutorial walks you through installing BeautifulSoup!](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beautifulsoup-installation-python/) 

INSERT MY LIBRARIES PICTURE

Next, we import the URL and check it using these functions...[these are the websites I used](https://www.food.com/ideas/top-dessert-recipes-6930?ref=nav#c-791391)(https://www.food.com/ideas/cookie-recipes-7152?ref=nav)

INSERT MY URL CODE

As we continue in the webscraping process, it is crucial to make sure the website you use allows for webscrapping. Check the robot.txt file to verify the rules the website has. In this example, the website allows for webscrapping as per the robot.txt file. 

<img src = "{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post_2 - dessert2.png" alt = "food"/>

Gathering data from a website can be tricky, but we will walk through the specific steps. Here is my code for reference. As you can see, we use functions from BeautifulSoup to collect the information necessary for our dataset.

I was interested in five columns for my dataset: Recipe name, comment, comment name, rank, and type of article. To see where this infomration lies, we will inspect our website. Simply right click the website and click the bottom option "inspect" to pull up a screen like this:

INSPECT SCREEN

As we look at the drop down, we can see that our item's all fall under the div tag in class "smart-card container-sm recipe", ass seen in my code.

the tags for each column is also presented in my code. To learn more about this here is a website explaining more about webscraping in BeautifulSoup! (INSERT LINK)

<img src = "{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post_2 - dessert3.png" alt = "food3"/>

My dataset was created after these steps! Now going back to the beginning, I wanted to know what made a recipe special enough to be in the top 100 recipes for dessert and top 100 for cookies. I thought of a few ways to examine this question:

1. How many of the dessert names contain "chocolate"

2. How many times the word "delicious" appears in a comment

3. Finding similarities across the top 5 dessert and cookie recipes
